        <p> Soak the beans overnight in 2 cups of water. The next morning, drain the excess water from the beans,
            rinse
            them well under running tap water 2 to 3 times and put them in a pressure cooker, add 2 to 3 cups of
            water
            and cook for 5 to 6 whistles and then cook on low flame for 15 minutes. Now, remove the cooker from
            flame,
            wait till the pressure is released and then take out the beans and keep aside. Now, boil the potatoes,
            peel
            and dice them into small cubes. Add salt, chaat masala, chopped coriander leaves and the butter to it.
            Mix
            well and mash the potatoes with a fork and keep aside. Butter the bread slices and spread the potato mix
            over the bread slices evenly. Preheat the oven to 200 C and bake the bread slices on a baking tray from
            10
            minutes. In a bowl mix the onions and some coriander leaves with chaat masala and keep aside. Now, put a
            spoonful of the baked beans on top of the mashed potatoes, sprinkle some onion and coriander leaves the
            mixture, top it off with some crisp sev and serve with tea or cold beverages.</p>
