            and beetroot to it. Heat the pan and add all the vegetables to it. Add 2 cups of water to it and boil it.
            Once the vegetables are cooked, smash them and make it into a fine thick paste. Meanwhile take Spice-bay
            leaf, Cinnamon, Cloves, Anise and Pepper and blend them.<br>

            Take 2 cups of water and 2 spoons of corn flour to it. Stir it well so that there are no lumps. Add the
            vegetable paste and the blended spice powder to the starch. Start boiling the mixture. Put it on low flame
            and stir well. Add salt, sugar and pepper as required. Garnish the soup with coriander leaves. Serve hot for
            great taste.<br>

            Note: You can even add as many vegetables as possible along with the tomatoes, making it a mixed vegetable
            soup.
